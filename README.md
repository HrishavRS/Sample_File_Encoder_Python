# File_Encryter

##Run File_Encoder.py with 'python3 File_Encoder.py' from your cmd 

#### Works Fine but Still has errors for some scenirios as of March 20th 2022
### Note: Should avoid Using it on Directory that has filename size greater than 120 of length in files and folders(This can be done with 'check for success' feature once encryption is selected after running the 'File_Encoder.py')
