# File_Encryter

##Run File_Encoder.py with 'python3 File_Encoder.py' from your cmd 

#### Works Fine but Still has errors for some scenirios as of March 20th 2022
### Note: Should test before using encrypt on a File Directory(This can be done with 'check for success' feature once encryption is selected after running the 'File_Encoder.py')
